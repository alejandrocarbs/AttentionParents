     <p> If your child is being bullied and they are open about it towards you, that's a sign of trust and love. Take that opportunity to listen and let your child talk about it. Listen in a non-judgemental way, asking questions such as; "What happened? How did it make you feel?" If they cry, let them. What your child needs to know is that he/she is being heard and that their feelings matter. </p>
